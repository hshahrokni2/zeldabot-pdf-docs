# Enhanced Extraction Improvements

## API Resilience Enhancements

### API Retry Logic Implementation

To address the persistent API errors (502, 520) encountered during benchmark runs, robust retry logic has been implemented in the enhanced extraction system:

1. **Exponential Backoff Retry**:
   - All API calls now use exponential backoff with up to 5 retries
   - Handles common error codes (502, 520, 429, 500, 503)
   - Initial delay of 1 second, doubling with each retry
   - Added in `enhanced_extraction_benchmark.py`

2. **API Key Flexibility**:
   - System now checks for both `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `CLAUDE_API_KEY` environment variables
   - Scripts detect and use whichever key is available
   - Updated `run_enhanced_benchmark.sh` to check for both variables
   - Added clear user messages about which key is being used

3. **Increased Timeouts**:
   - API request timeout increased from default to 60 seconds
   - Helps handle slow API responses during high traffic periods

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Improved error handling with detailed logging
   - Clearer error messages for troubleshooting
   - Graceful continuation even if some API batches fail

## Documentation Updates

1. **Benchmark Testing Documentation**:
   - Updated `BENCHMARK_TESTING.md` with retry logic information
   - Added detailed API troubleshooting steps
   - Documented environmental variables and configuration options

2. **Run Script Improvements**:
   - Enhanced error reporting in benchmark script
   - Added more descriptive output during processing
   - Flexible API key handling in shell scripts

## Next Steps

1. **Benchmark Completion**:
   - Run full benchmark suite with retry logic
   - Document results and compare with pre-consolidation 96.8% accuracy

2. **Potential Further Improvements**:
   - Implement caching for API calls to reduce rate limit issues
   - Add batching optimization to reduce total API calls
   - Consider implementing parallel processing for faster extraction
