# Enhanced Extraction System Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive test plan for validating and benchmarking the enhanced extraction system for Swedish Housing Association (BRF) annual reports. The plan focuses specifically on validating the rich information extraction capabilities of enhanced_tradgarden_processor_v2.py with BRF Trädgården and similar documents.

## Test Objectives
