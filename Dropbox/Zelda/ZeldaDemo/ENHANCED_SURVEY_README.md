if construction_year < 1960:
    avg_apt_size = 65  # m¬≤
elif construction_year < 1990:
    avg_apt_size = 75  # m¬≤
else:
    avg_apt_size = 85  # m¬≤

total_m2 = property_count * avg_apt_size * 1.2  # +20% for common areas
```

### Financial Performance Index
```python
energy_efficiency_score = max(0, 100 - (energy_performance / 159 * 100))
cost_efficiency_score = max(0, 100 - (cost_per_m2 / market_average * 100))
financial_performance_index = (energy_efficiency_score * 0.3) + (cost_efficiency_score * 0.7)
```
