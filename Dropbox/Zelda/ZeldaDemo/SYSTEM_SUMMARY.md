- **Validation & Progress Tracking**: Real-time completion percentage
- **Mobile-Responsive Design**: Touch-friendly interface with accessibility features

### 2. Peer Comparison Engine (`peer_comparison_system.py`)
- **"Half Peers Visible" System**: Progressive data disclosure based on completion
- **Statistical Benchmarking**: Median, averages, percentiles with confidence levels
- **AI-Driven Insights**: Cost-saving recommendations with action items
- **Supplier Alternatives**: Side-by-side comparisons with potential savings
- **Export Functionality**: JSON, Excel, CSV formats

### 3. Integrated Application (`integrated_survey_map_app.py`)
- **Tab-Based Navigation**: Map, Survey, Comparison, Export sections
- **Seamless Integration**: Building selection flows from map to survey
- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-first design with accessibility compliance
- **Session Management**: Persistent state across navigation
- **Visual Feedback**: Progress indicators and unlock status displays

### 4. Supporting Infrastructure
