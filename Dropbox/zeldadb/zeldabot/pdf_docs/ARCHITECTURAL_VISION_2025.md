## üéØ THE VISION: FULLY INTELLIGENT SYSTEM

### **What We're Building:**
An intelligent document processing system where every component can learn and adapt:

```
PDF Document
    ‚Üì
üß† LLM Sectionizer (with coaching)
    - Extracts 3-level hierarchy
    - Learns to find sections better
    - Outputs hierarchical map with context
    ‚Üì
üìä Hierarchical Section Map
{
  "sections": [
    {
      "name": "F√∂rvaltningsber√§ttelse",
      "start_page": 3,
      "end_page": 6,
      "level": 1,
      "subsections": [
        {"name": "Styrelsen", "level": 2, "context": "Board composition and roles"},
        {"name": "Fastighetsfakta", "level": 2, "context": "Property details"},
        {"name": "Teknisk status", "level": 2, "context": "Technical condition"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
    ‚Üì
üß† LLM Orchestrator (NEW)
    - Reads and understands structure
    - Decides which agents to use
    - Creates extraction strategy
    - Adapts to document variations
    ‚Üì
ü§ñ Specialized Agents (24 types)
    - Each with coaching loops
    - Domain-specific expertise
    - Continuous improvement
    ‚Üì
üíæ DB/JSON Sync
    - Improvements persist
    - Knowledge accumulates
    - Fast cache + source of truth
```

## üìç CURRENT STATE vs TARGET STATE

### **Component 1: Sectionizer**

| Aspect | Current State | Target State | Gap |
|--------|--------------|--------------|-----|
| **Hierarchy** | Extracts 3 levels ‚úÖ | Outputs hierarchical structure | Need to modify output format |
| **Output** | Flat list with pages | Nested with subsection context | Missing subsection descriptions |
| **Coaching** | None ‚ùå | 5-round improvement loop | Need to implement |
| **Storage** | Not stored | Cached with improvements | Need DB integration |

### **Component 2: Orchestrator**

| Aspect | Current State | Target State | Gap |
|--------|--------------|--------------|-----|
| **Intelligence** | ~~Pure Python logic~~ ‚úÖ LLM-based | LLM-based decisions | **COMPLETED** |
| **Adaptability** | ~~Hard-coded~~ ‚úÖ Context-aware | Understands context | **COMPLETED** |
| **Strategy** | ~~Blind~~ ‚úÖ Intelligent routing | Intelligent routing | **COMPLETED** |
| **Learning** | None | Improves over time | Need coaching loop |

### **Component 3: Agents**

| Aspect | Current State | Target State | Gap |
|--------|--------------|--------------|-----|
| **Prompts** | Mixed (bad files + good JSON) | Only good JSON cache ‚úÖ | Delete bad templates |
| **Coaching** | Working ‚úÖ | Working ‚úÖ | None |
| **Sync** | DB ‚Üî JSON working ‚úÖ | DB ‚Üî JSON working ‚úÖ | None |

### **Component 4: Infrastructure**

| Aspect | Current State | Target State | Gap |
|--------|--------------|--------------|-----|
| **Models** | Qwen + Gemini | Qwen + Gemini + GPT? | Test GPT-OSS option |
| **Transport** | HF-Direct ‚úÖ | HF-Direct ‚úÖ | None |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL ‚úÖ | PostgreSQL ‚úÖ | None |

## üî¥ CRITICAL GAPS TO ADDRESS

### **Gap 1: Orchestrator is Not Intelligent** (CRITICAL)
The orchestrator being pure logic is the **biggest architectural flaw**. It cannot:
- Understand what's in each section
- Make intelligent routing decisions
- Adapt to document variations
- Learn from experience

**Solution**: Replace with LLM-based orchestrator (Card 4 in plan)

### **Gap 2: Sectionizer Output is Flat**
The sectionizer finds hierarchy but outputs flat structure, losing valuable context.

**Solution**: Enhance output format (Card 2 in plan)

### **Gap 3: Bad Prompts Still Exist**
File templates with 6-line prompts pollute the system.

**Solution**: Delete them completely (Card 3 in plan)

### **Gap 4: No Sectionizer Coaching**
Sectionizer doesn't improve over time like agents do.

**Solution**: Add coaching loop (Card 5 in plan)

## üéØ TARGET CAPABILITIES

When complete, the system will:

1. **Understand Document Structure**
   - LLM reads hierarchical map
   - Comprehends relationships
   - Makes intelligent decisions

2. **Adapt to Variations**
   - Different PDF structures handled
   - Context-aware processing
   - No hard-coded assumptions

3. **Continuously Improve**
   - Every component has coaching
   - Knowledge persists
   - Performance increases over time

4. **Process Intelligently**
   - Right agent for right content
   - Efficient resource use
   - High accuracy extraction

## üìä SUCCESS METRICS

The system is successful when:

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Sectioning Accuracy** | >95% sections found | ~70% |
| **Extraction Accuracy** | >85% fields correct | ~60% |
| **Processing Time** | <5 min per document | ~8 min |
| **Coaching Effectiveness** | >20% improvement | 15% |
| **Adaptability** | Handles any PDF structure | Limited |

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION PATH

Follow the 7-card plan in `ORCHESTRATOR_REDESIGN_PLAN.md`:

1. **Test LLM Options** (Card 1)
2. **Delete Bad Prompts** (Card 3) 
3. **Enhance Sectionizer** (Card 2)
4. **Build LLM Orchestrator** (Card 4)
5. **Add Sectionizer Coaching** (Card 5)
6. **Integration Testing** (Card 6)
7. **Performance Validation** (Card 7)

**Each card has:**
- TDD test to write first
- Implementation steps
- Verification by TDD agent
- Clear success criteria

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS

### **Why Logic Orchestrator Failed:**
Every PDF is unique. Hard-coded logic assumes structure that doesn't exist. Only an LLM can understand and adapt to variations.

### **Why Hierarchy Matters:**
Subsections provide context that helps the orchestrator make intelligent decisions about which agents to deploy.

### **Why Coaching Everything:**
Documents evolve. The system must learn and improve continuously, not just for extraction but for understanding structure too.

### **Why Delete Bad Prompts:**
They're a crutch that prevents using the sophisticated agent system. Remove temptation to fall back to generic templates.

## üìù REMEMBER

**The orchestrator is the brain of the system. If it's not intelligent, the whole system is handicapped.**

Current pure logic orchestrator = Trying to navigate a city with a list of turn instructions instead of understanding the map.

LLM orchestrator = Understanding the city layout and making intelligent routing decisions.

**This is not an enhancement. This is fixing a fundamental architectural flaw.**
